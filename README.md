# ML-for-Finance
In this project we applied recurrent neural networks on the time-series stock data of the 500 companies in the S&P500 with the intention to predict changes in the S&P500. 

Motivation came from the following article: https://medium.com/mlreview/a-simple-deep-learning-model-for-stock-price-prediction-using-tensorflow-30505541d877
